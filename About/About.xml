Ice is slippery to walk on!

Pawns will have a risk of falling when walking on icy surfaces. If they fall it will take a little while to get up again.
There are options to set the risk of falling as well as selecting what type of pawns it should affect.
By default only humanoid pawns will have a risk of falling.
