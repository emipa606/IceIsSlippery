Ice is slippery to walk on!

Pawns will have a risk of falling when walking on icy surfaces. If they fall it will take a little while to get up again.
There are options to set the risk of falling as well as selecting what type of pawns it should affect.
By default only humanoid pawns will have a risk of falling.

Supported mods that adds ice-terrain:


-  [Nature's Pretty Sweet](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2532618635)
-  [Water Freezes](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3278128973)
-  [Celsius](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2725863762)
-  [[RF] Fishing-ReWork](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920098766)
-  [Rimedieval - Ice Revamped](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3168102959)
-  [SZ_StonesAndTerrains](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874663469)



Adding more terrain as slippery only requires the adding of a mod extension via a patch. See the included patches as an example.

To stop your colonists and visitors from walking on the ice I suggest building bridges and use [[KV] Path Avoid](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180719857) or [Clean Pathfinding 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3260446812) to keep them on their feet.
